Legaleese is technical, precise, strives to eliminate double entendre and incertitudes ; Legaleese wins.

1,"Your point is the US makes and sells weapons and that is the reality of the situation, which does provide a decent source of income for the nation. I don't even disagree with that, because it isn't like the US hasn't done that in the past and it will continue to do so into the future. Weapons exist, so someone has to make and sell them. How am I doing so far? Has your assumption paid off yet?

Before I go on I'll just remark that I always take TYT with a grain of salt, because frankly they're a little too overtly bias for the left and I've seen them make errors. I do consider myself a leftist, probably farther left than most. Regardless I want accurate information, not preaching to the choir. 

Now that we have that out of the way. You seem to be asserting that they are saying that making weapons is bad and they should not be sold to other countries because weapons are evil anti-flower loving things blah blah blah, and that is their argument against Trump in this case. But, nothing like that is ever said throughout the video, there's nothing about denying the reality that the US makes arms and sell those arms. The main point brought up is not being a moron by having the oversight of those sales done by a department that doesn't have the experience required to determine whether or not those weapons are going to someone who could be a potential threat out of a short-sighted desire to sell more of them.

And then the slightly more subjective point of how sad it is that Trump is going around trying to sell weapons to people like a door to door salesman who gets the door slammed in his face half the time because he's desperate for approval. But like I said, that's pretty subjective and not of any significant substance.  

So in summery, selling weapons is a reality that exists, and that's fine. Just be smart about it. And... you're ugly. Or something, since apparently personal appearance seems to somehow add value to an argument according to you."

You think you have a coherent framework, but all you have is your own opinions. The 2nd amendment is ambiguous enough that many differing federal laws can be enacted while still upholding the 2nd amendment.

Tell me, what arms should be regulated? If you start there, then I'll entertain a conversation.

If you want to pretend all arms should be legal, then why doesn't The Walton Family or George Soros have the right to purchase a nuclear weapon?

Perhaps you interpret the word ""bear"" to mean: able to carry on ones body.
But dirty bombs are able to be carried on ones own body. So should those be legal? Why or why not?

Notice, the 2nd amendment does not mention fire arms or guns, just arms."

And where do you suppose all their firearms come from? A large percentage of firearms used in criminal activity in Chicago for example are sourced from surrounding states with incredibly laxed gun regulations. Those guns are bought by ""dummy purchasers"" in states not enforcing background checks with the intent to sell them on the streets of Chicago. The reason this is allowed to continue is because of REPUBLICANS who are bought off by the gun industry, it's not a Democrat disease, it's a REPUBLICAN disease."

Congrats, both the left and the right have reached a level playing field of extremism, violence and racism.

And in all the stupidity since Trump got elected, the left has ended up making a lot of conservative personalities end up lookign reasonable, and pushed liberals more to the right of the political spectrum.

The left destroyed their own base, forgot what being an actual LIBERAL meant, and turned into a bunch of ideological extremists, basing everything off identity politics, reversing the progress of race relations, and treating people SPECIFICALLY based on their race, and sex, and creating a progressive stack - the left turned into the racist equivalent of conservatives on the far right.

0,"So the problems with my argument is things I never wrote, we don't know what happened behind the scenes so as far as we know the overreaction isn't on the part of Swift.

Secondly you're basically saying that if you receive a false label then if you're not careful with your response (thou doth protest too much) or not respond at all then that makes the label true paying no attention to the guy spreading falsehoods. No, its still false.

Taylor Swift shouldn't have to respond to me if for example I make a video claiming that her music videos are full of satanic imagery that compels people to murder the elderly, any articles paying any credence to my video without supporting evidence isn't journalism but mere click seeking and that should be the real story not Swift's lawyer doing his or her job."

1,I Dislike Bannon but i agreed with his Libertarian Foreign Policy... Now with a Cabinet full of the Military industrial complex.. Non interventionists on the Right are legitimately cautious about what the future of Foreign Policy out of the Trump administration will entail.
