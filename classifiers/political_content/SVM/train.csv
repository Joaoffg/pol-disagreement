The gogo 90's can be attributed to the internet age, which lead to a bubble, and NAFTA, which lead to a furthering decline of manufacturing. Nafta spurred economic growth as the US was ramping up to profit off its implementation, but as the policy matured the result was clear, Wall St profits would go up and wages and benefits would go down."

1,"Your point is the US makes and sells weapons and that is the reality of the situation, which does provide a decent source of income for the nation. I don't even disagree with that, because it isn't like the US hasn't done that in the past and it will continue to do so into the future. Weapons exist, so someone has to make and sell them. How am I doing so far? Has your assumption paid off yet?

Before I go on I'll just remark that I always take TYT with a grain of salt, because frankly they're a little too overtly bias for the left and I've seen them make errors. I do consider myself a leftist, probably farther left than most. Regardless I want accurate information, not preaching to the choir. 

Now that we have that out of the way. You seem to be asserting that they are saying that making weapons is bad and they should not be sold to other countries because weapons are evil anti-flower loving things blah blah blah, and that is their argument against Trump in this case. But, nothing like that is ever said throughout the video, there's nothing about denying the reality that the US makes arms and sell those arms. The main point brought up is not being a moron by having the oversight of those sales done by a department that doesn't have the experience required to determine whether or not those weapons are going to someone who could be a potential threat out of a short-sighted desire to sell more of them.

And then the slightly more subjective point of how sad it is that Trump is going around trying to sell weapons to people like a door to door salesman who gets the door slammed in his face half the time because he's desperate for approval. But like I said, that's pretty subjective and not of any significant substance.  

So in summery, selling weapons is a reality that exists, and that's fine. Just be smart about it. And... you're ugly. Or something, since apparently personal appearance seems to somehow add value to an argument according to you."

1,lol... the guy can barely even speak in proper English. so let's get this straight... anyone who is against building more killing machines to increase corporate profits is anti-American?  listen you fool.  there isnt one definition of what is patriotic.  unfortunately some people like you equate it with the status quo of military power and conflict.  who said anything about making the US communist?  and if anything it is Republicans who want to take us back to slavery.  you are seriously twisted by right wing propaganda.  you are your own worst enemy.

You think you have a coherent framework, but all you have is your own opinions. The 2nd amendment is ambiguous enough that many differing federal laws can be enacted while still upholding the 2nd amendment.

Tell me, what arms should be regulated? If you start there, then I'll entertain a conversation.

If you want to pretend all arms should be legal, then why doesn't The Walton Family or George Soros have the right to purchase a nuclear weapon?

Perhaps you interpret the word ""bear"" to mean: able to carry on ones body.
But dirty bombs are able to be carried on ones own body. So should those be legal? Why or why not?

And where do you suppose all their firearms come from? A large percentage of firearms used in criminal activity in Chicago for example are sourced from surrounding states with incredibly laxed gun regulations. Those guns are bought by ""dummy purchasers"" in states not enforcing background checks with the intent to sell them on the streets of Chicago. The reason this is allowed to continue is because of REPUBLICANS who are bought off by the gun industry, it's not a Democrat disease, it's a REPUBLICAN disease."

Your ""feelings"" do not give you the right to strip others of their personal freedoms.  Women can wear whatever they want, and some whackjob religious nutters ""feelings"" does not trump her personal freedom to dress how she wants.

When the SJW's and racists on the left start talking about microaggressions and safe spaces, where you think you can strip someone else of their basic human rights just to satisfy your ""Feelings"", you nutjobs end up sounding just as delusional as this Eqyptian lawyer.  People talking about punching nazi's, and attacking trump supporters, having dorms that exclude whites, having black-only graduations at College.....  Congrats, both the left and the right have reached a level playing field of extremism, violence and racism.

And in all the stupidity since Trump got elected, the left has ended up making a lot of conservative personalities end up lookign reasonable, and pushed liberals more to the right of the political spectrum.

The left destroyed their own base, forgot what being an actual LIBERAL meant, and turned into a bunch of ideological extremists, basing everything off identity politics, reversing the progress of race relations, and treating people SPECIFICALLY based on their race, and sex, and creating a progressive stack - the left turned into the racist equivalent of conservatives on the far right.

So why would I prefer lawyers to bullet-proof a bill ? Because of Legaleese. Politicians use their own lingo, but when one wants to circumvent a legal constraint, one gets a lawyer.
It looks a lot like Ro-Sham-Bo. Politician speak is often vague enough to bore loopholes in many texts. Legaleese is technical, precise, strives to eliminate double entendre and incertitudes ; Legaleese wins. My theoretical politician would hire the most vicious lawyers he/she could find to make his/her bill as unassailable, as unambiguous, as self sufficient, as rhetorically inert as possible.

Your trying to make an argument that the Confederacy was making after seceding. Because they wanted to be seen as a new nation. They weren't before that, it was all a ploy to keep they're slaves and not have to adhere to Federal Government. Get over it, they lost, so if you want to believe that way, fine.....that's the way it was, until the Union was re-united. See, the government never recognized the Confederacy as a nation, that's why it was treasonous. All you needed to say was, it isn't treasonous to display the flag in your own private property."

Secondly you're basically saying that if you receive a false label then if you're not careful with your response (thou doth protest too much) or not respond at all then that makes the label true paying no attention to the guy spreading falsehoods. No, its still false.

Taylor Swift shouldn't have to respond to me if for example I make a video claiming that her music videos are full of satanic imagery that compels people to murder the elderly, any articles paying any credence to my video without supporting evidence isn't journalism but mere click seeking and that should be the real story not Swift's lawyer doing his or her job."
