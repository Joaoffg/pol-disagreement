Those are ""elected officials"", not public servants. Public servants simply implement the policy determined by them, and I suspect have their expenses pretty carefully scrutinised.

Other than that I agree that politicians should focus on the long term and the interests of all Australians rather than the game of seeking power, feathering nests and doing favours. But I guess they don't show up in the media if they're actually doing a good job because the media hungers for spectable, anger and division.

> My view is based on the principle that the party nomination processes are private affairs

The problem is that you have a two party system, by design. Since it is effectively required that one of the two parties are selected, that makes the selection of the party representative as important as the selection of your president. 

Looking from the outside, it seems the GOP has gotten so crazy that the Democrats are guaranteed the win (assuming they don't do something incredibly stupid). Thus, the selection of the representative has basically become equivalent to the selection of the president. Even if it was a close race, the choice of representative is where the major policy decisions are made. So if you want a more representative democracy, you should allow more influence from the population. 

There is nothing ""fundamentally"" wrong with what you have. However, it could be a lot better by allowing more influence from the population.

">  Even if my some even more unlikely miracle Sanders became POTUS he would either have to relent to the power of the American bourgeoisie or prepare to die (is it really so outrageous to think that a socialist American president would not make it to the end of his term alive?).

This kind of catastrophist stuff always makes me lol. First of all, the biggest obstacle Sanders will face won't be the Pentagon but a hostile Republican Congress (although I think if Sanders is on the ballot in November 2016 the GOP stands a chance of losing control of both houses). Secondly, Sanders isn't about to establish the dictatorship of the proletariat or seize major industries or anything remotely life-threatening to the big bourgeoisie of this country. They won't organize a coup to save Citizens United -- heck, they didn't even organize a coup to oust FDR. I'm sure they will fight him and oppose him at all turns, but coups and things like that are their last line of defense, not their first.

As for Sanders' chances of winning against Clinton, [it's a real possibility](https://pplswar.wordpress.com/2015/06/24/sanders-can-win-the-democratic-presidential-primary-heres-how-2/) and not impossible given that socialist Upton Sinclair [did something similar in 1934.](https://revolutionaryds.wordpress.com/2015/01/29/how-upton-sinclair-upended-californias-democratic-party-and-the-lessons-for-bernie-sanders-2016-run/). Even if he loses to Clinton, there's a lot of value in the Sanders campaign (good article on that topic [here](http://newpol.org/content/assessing-sanders-campaign) -- he's rehabilitating the legitimacy of socialism on a mass scale, he'll boost Jill Stein's vote, and he'll draw in huge numbers of politically inexperienced people who will go onto other activist projects and left electoral campaigns.",1

"> It is simply my view that going to war with feminism is a waste of energy, but gender specific issues do not need to be a militant war of attrition.

Meanwhile RAINN just took our position on 'Rape Culture':

>In 16 pages of recommendations, RAINN urged the task focus to remain focused on the true cause of the problem. ‚ÄúIn the last few years, there has been an unfortunate trend towards blaming ‚Äúrape culture‚Äù for the extensive problem of sexual violence on campuses. While it is helpful to point out the systemic barriers to addressing the problem, it is important to not lose sight of a simple fact: Rape is caused not by cultural factors but by the conscious decisions, of a small percentage of the community, to commit a violent crime,‚Äù said the letter to the task force from RAINN‚Äôs president, Scott Berkowitz, and vice president for public policy, Rebecca O‚ÄôConnor.

So tell me again how going to war with feminists (positions) is a waste of time...

>In this instance, we can campaign and lobby to outlaw circumcision; feminists need not be mentioned nor consulted for their opinion

Feminist have actively worked to minimize MGM or even supported it. They have more lobbying power than we do so changing their attitudes is critical to our success.

> They are irrelevant when it comes to male issues as they've already proven that they are incapable of balanced advocacy, they're a female advocacy group.

They actively lobby against men's issues and men's inclusion in their issues.  They are even hostile to men being apart of their cause.  You can't get around their influence so you have to take them on.

">I think people's main issues with taxation is that the money we give is not used how we would like or in a manner that we have agreed or been consulted on. Take federal income tax, that is used for wars and supporting military industrial complex. No one ever asked me if I wanted to give money to drone strike a wedding in Pakistan or if I wanted to set up an new military base in Australia. I have a huge problem with that. 

I have a huge problem with that as well, not to mention the drones that will be flying over the US in the next couple of years. However, you won't see me complaining about taxes - but rather the need to change policy. 

>As far as I can tell Libertarians believed that these needs could be better met through private industries and charities

The fundamental flaw with private charities (don't get me wrong I fully support charities) is that they are severely under-equipped to handle everyone's basic needs. Second, we shouldn't have majority of people living at the whim of charitable giving of other people. In my perspective, government performs these functions much more better due to the resources and tools available to it. Private charities are great as supplemental to government social safety nets - but they shouldn't be the primary resource for aid. 

>I think it is also believed that government intervention in the economy also in the cause of massive recessions and depressions in the first place. 

While I don't dispute this - my criticism in this regard is levied at the Federal Reserve and their monetary policies. It's their monetary policies that result in the devaluing and inflating of the dollar thereby lowering everyone's purchasing power to consume goods because asset prices like commodities are more expensive.

>My problem with the philosophy is how to make that transition from our current state to a libertarian society.

I would say that people like myself who like to have paved roads, police, fire, and schools (all funded by taxes) would prevent a true libertarian society from happening. 

>How do we get people on their feet and how do we deal with the current inequality what we are faced with. 

Very good question and I don't really have an answer for it (at least not one that you would like). I will say that for a capitalistic society to be successful, inequality needs to be low. High inequality leads to the collapse of capitalism. 

>I don't want the government involved in every aspect of my day to day life but I also want to make sure the people in my community who need help can receive it.

Civil Cervantes authorised the destruction of medical notes but yet no civil service names were ever recorded! Behind closed doors the Government have left this to go on for as long as possible. I was infected with Hep C through treatment for my Haemophilia and so was my grandad who died because of the Hep C. Can you imagine not only loosing your own dad due to infection but also facing the fact your own child, who you took to hospital to get treatment might also die at some point! Horrendous circumstance that could have been avoided instead Thatcher opted for money saving agenda instead of a potential life saving agenda. Fortunately after 18 months of brutal treatment I managed to clear the Hep C but for many others they never had the chance. A crime against the British public that should not go unpunished and answers must be given to ensure the chances of something like ever happening again are minimal.



Afraid the NHS were warned but they did nothing. It's all documented. That's why people have been seeking answers for the last 35 years?

Here in MN, like the rest of reddit, the name ""Donald Trump"" is synonymous with Adolf Hitler. If I talk about my support for Trump in public, I get glares like none other. It discouraged me from fully supporting Trump for a while just because of the social pressure!

You were endowed with some magic privilege that makes everything easy.

I felt like a bit of a loner in my support for Donald. Like something was wrong with me for not being disgusted with Trump like everyone else. But alas, I have determined it is because we, the fortunate, possess the anticuck gene and are immune to this rapidly spreading, dangerous, dangerous cuckvirus. 

I could not find one person in my school (as a high school senior, 18) who shares my passion for Trump. All I hear is ""He's a bully, a dick, an overt racist, cannot be defended, and I hate him ***soooooo*** much."" Even my Republican friends think he is, ""unpresidential and a racist who doesn't like brown people."" 

Meanwhile, I hear nothing but admiration for Comrade Sandcuck. What is it with kids and socialism nowadays?? I think it's that they don't have the foresight older people have to know that IT DOESN'T WORK. Sounds great, Yeah. But it makes everyone worse off. Poverty will always exist for a few! It sucks cock but it's been that way for EVERY major civilization in history.

 America is the only place where people can be mostly free from this bullshit. If someone has a talent of value, and they put it to good use, THEY ARE REWARDED WITH MONEY. GET OVER IT. Either you have something of value or you don't. I don't want to work hard in college to get a degree in engineering just for some cuck to say ""Yeah, 50+% of what you make is ours because less fortunate people blah blah blah blah.""

Onto my main point, I should be able to support **whomever I fucking please** for president. I thought this was America!! I don't appreciate cuckos acting like all Trump supporters are some kind of uneducated racist sexist asses and that if you support Trump it's equivalent with hate speech. Not gonna happen anymore.

So that is why I love this subreddit. This is the ONE place you can support Trump and not have to deal with the BS, only love. I love checking this page every day and I love seeing all you faggots comment things like ""BUILD THE WALL."" We truly have the best shitposters, the dankest of memes, and we win and win and win thanks to our mods. And we sure as hell have more fun than S4P.

Last night was too glorious, and we have so much high energy here it's amazing. This is the only place on reddit you can offend everyone and still get upvoted a ton. But we *aren't* offensive people! We are just passionate about Trump and SJW's get caught in the crossfire! No, it's more like they run into a train.

"Dear Americans, no one is coming to take your guns. Why do you fear small provisions as if it's the end of the world? I have no studies or polls I trust so I‚Äôm not going to put any numbers up but, can you guys just please see this from outside the box for one sec?

Everywhere there are stricter gun laws, gun deaths are lower. Even if you want to hunt, who needs 30 bullets to stop a deer? You will still have the access and ability to buy guns. If the federal government banned the carrying of handguns, won't mean you can't have your handgun. I just never understood the mentality of ""I need my AR-15, 500 round, suppressor, laser sited, grenade launching, and exploding bullet gun to protect my family.""

You guys seem to think that once someone becomes president, they become a foreigner and want to break the laws. Obama is just as American as Ronald Reagan, as was Lincoln. The government is not going to take the guns. And if they do I think it will be a little more obvious; and if that day comes, sure, start your rebellion. I'm sure when four score and seven years ago the fore-fathers drafted the constitution, they had no idea muskets would turn into 30 round AK-47 rifles. They wrote this amendment for MUSKETS. I bet 100 bucks if they were alive today they'd be ashamed, and re-write the rules to be something about owning 5 clip mag rifle. Something to stall an enemy force till the real military could arrive.

Another note I never got was, the constitution says ""Arms for a well-regulated militia."" Not ""Everyone has guns yay, shoot thy neighbor if he walks on your lawn."" Militia: (Noun) a military force that is raised from the civil population to supplement a regular army in an emergency. How is Bill down the street a militia? I'm sorry but I don't see the downside to having an AR-15 with a 5 clip mag, which can't be held in public and has to be stored away properly as a bad thing. You can still hunt, you can still defend your family, you can still form a militia.

But then again I'm Canadian... what do I know.

TLDR: Calm your tits, no one is taking your guns, the Government is not waging war against the people, and you have a massive gun problem.

PSS: If you know the proper form this should be posted in, please let me know. And i'm being 100% sincere when I wrote this.",1

"Disclaimer: I'm a Democrat. For the most part, I consider myself a fairly moderate person, with a few crazy bleeding heart liberal ideals like ""healthcare is a right, not a commodity"", etc. I am friends with some moderate republicans, and we always have great discourse and can find great value in each others ideas. Unfortunately, moderate Republicans have had their party stolen from them.

* The right wing has completely gone off the deep end, to the point that Newt Gingrich is being handed his ass for suggesting seriously that we work together as Americans instead of trying to ""Win"" as republicans and Democrats.

* The Left wing is pretty much a center/center-right wing now, leaving us with very few true leftist politics.

* Tea Party candidates have essentially proposed the rape of the middle class as their platform and are being congratulated for being so ""bold"".

* The MSM doesn't cover moderate or left wing ideas with regard to budget.

* Politicians left and right are demonstrably owned by their corporate overlords.

* Nobody has the balls to actually vote third party, because it means the other ""team"" might win.

**TL;DR:** As a moderate, it feels like America is being marched off a cliff by the extreme elements of the right wing, who refuse to compromise or negotiate in politics, and that neither moderate republicans nor anyone else has the courage to stand up to them, or if they do, the media simply doesn't cover it.",1

"Education policy in the United States is very complicated and diverse, because it is mostly under the control of locally elected school boards, which meet their expenses mostly by assessing property taxes within the district. There are around 16,000 [school districts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_district) in the United States, each with its own board. A school district typically covers a single city or town, and sometimes includes the rural area surrounding a town. Where towns (villages) are very small, a district might include 2 or more nearby towns.

States, either through their state constitutions or state laws, can place limits on what local school boards can do. Also, states can offer incentives to local school boards, rewarding them with cash subsidies if they meet certain criteria. That means there are 50 different systems of limits and incentives.

The federal government can't, either by legislation or executive order, control either states or school boards directly, but it can offer incentives. States and school boards can choose to ignore the incentives and forgo the benefits of meeting the fed's criteria.

Also, policies are continually changing.

**So any time you ask ""Does X exist in the United States?"" the answer is almost always: ""Yes, it exists in some places but not everywhere.""** And compiling a list of places where it exists is difficult, and any such list would quickly go out of date.

As a result of all this decentralized control, aid to religious schools has not been attempted everywhere. Where it has been attempted, the methods vary greatly. The US Supreme court has allowed some methods and disallowed others.

All I'll add is that Christianity is constantly changing because the people within that faith are always changing.  Christianity, and religion in general, has always adapted to its believers and the world in which it exists.  From the 95 Theses (and before) to present day faiths (both liberal and conservative), Christianity has changed along with its followers.  Of course there are major elements that will always stay the same (I doubt any Christian sect will ever revise the Ten Commandments, etc), but so much of organized religion exists within the community of its believers, that it can't help but change.  


Some of the things that OP lists (homosexuality, the theological examining of Heaven and Hell, putting faith into practice) have changed dramatically, even within the most conservative sects of Christianity.  How many years ago was it widely thought that it was an abomination for races to intermarry?  How many years before was slavery considered to be a morally defensible practice?


Faith can adapt to a changing world and changing people.  New circumstances can shed new light on old teachings.  This doesn't negate or discount what you might have believed before.  It's just different.  I don't see anything wrong with that.



As an aside, if you believe that faith should be rigid or unyielding, I don't think this is the subreddit, the website nor the medium for you.  The internet and its denizens are a constantly evolving collection of ideas and discussions.  This place is all about questions and debate and exchange.  All of those things change ideas and change minds.  ",1

"I'll piggy-back on this to provide some more thoughts about why I agree with /u/Honest_Discussion's prediction.

Sander's is running a legislative platform for the presidency, which is common these days. Many of his proposals would require significant legislative action. For example, Sanders is running a universal education plan would require a significant restructuring of the financial aid apparatus, changes to the revenue code, and likely the creation of a new agency to oversee it. He is also running a major legislative plan to break-up the banks. He is on the record of supporting another major overhaul of the healthcare system, which would likely require a repeal and replace of the ACA. He would like to see significant changes to early-year childcare and regulations on maternity and paternity leave, which would require significant legislative pushes.

You may support these proposals, and that is perfectly fine. I can understand why people would. I support some and don't support others.

The problem is, Sanders is not running for a legislative position, he is running for the executive. Every major policy proposal he has put forward would be almost like another ACA, a massive change to existing structures that requires significant coordination with a legislature that is not as committed to the policies as Sanders would be and that is likely to be hostile (even if the Dems make gains during his presidency).

That means that most of the 'simple' and 'common-sense' proposals Sanders puts forward in his presidency are, ultimately, out of his hands. He can recommend them, he can find friends in the legislature that help craft the legislation he wants, but ultimately all he can do is apply political pressure. With a hostile legislature, this is likely to lead to a lot of, as /u/Honest_Discussion suggests, 'non-stop gridlock, whining, and finger pointing'. If Sanders is able to get half of his policy proposals through the legislature, they will in the end rely on 'imperfect deals' that resemble the original intent only if you squint hard enough.

Sanders, of course, has been a legislator since 1991, so he knows this. He's no straight-talker or common-sense hero. He may have policy recommendations closest to your interests, and if he does than by all means vote for him. But don't expect anything close to the high expectations many will have for him if he wins, because he simply can't achieve it. To the extent he can, it will require a lot of nasty and back-room politics to get there‚Äîand 'there' will not be what you voted for.

Personally, even if you care about these issues, I don't think you should vote for Sanders. Many of his issues could be achieved in a more moderate form, or the over-arching goals could be achieved through other means, by someone with more refined political skills. But I personally think Sanders will be unlikely to yield these results. He's a populist legislator, and its telling that while he has a lot of big legislative plans he hasn't taken the lead in achieving them in the 24 years he's been there. You'd be better off finding someone who had the executive skills required to actually improve the functioning of our government and marshall less hostile legislative coalitions.",1

"I'm not sure if it's appropriate for your story, but a tried-and-true method is the fish out of water protagonist.

Think of Luke Skywalker from Star Wars, for example-- he's new to the Jedi ways, and he asks questions and makes assumptions in the second movie that we, the viewers, would also be making. When Yoda answers his questions, it's not only consistent with the character relationship, it's an immense help to us as well.

This tends to work well in the Fantasy genres especially, when there's knowledge that is gained by the main character.

If, however, the knowledge you need the reader to understand is common knowledge... well, that's more tricky.

You want to avoid at all costs what Sanderson calls the maid-and-butler form of exposition. One character comes in and starts to explain things that both people already know, for the benefit of the readers. ""As you know, our lord has recently purchased a good deal of blah blah etc., etc.""

This is an extreme example, to be sure, but watch out for it in your writing.

It's hard to meet a good balance, and I honestly practice is the best way to do it. Write a piece of exposition, and then read it and decide for yourself whether it's too subtle or not enough. Re-write it, and try again. Get some friends to read it, and see what they think. Soon enough, you will find your own style and your own comfort level with these sort of things.

Good luck!",0

"I've read in several places, it seems, that Spencer W. Kimball held the vote on the reversal of the Priesthood ban when one or more of the more racist apostles were out of town.

Who were they?

What's the most primary source that we have to substantiate this?

Here's an example, from a comment in [a rational faith's post](http://rationalfaiths.com/revelation-bias-fair-balanced-part-4-blacks-priesthood/):

> Without going into too much detail, there was some political manuvering done by President Kimbal to get the policy reversed. He **waited until some of the more racist apostles were out of town when the vote was made** to reverse the ban. When they came back into town he told them how the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles had voted and asked if they were on board with it.

[I was talking with my parents about this, and they asked me ""which apostles""?]

The United Kingdom for several years had a Baby Bond program where every baby born there was given a small bond from the government, and I believe there may be a few local governments in the U.S. with a similar program.

AND YET, nearly every proposal I have seen for a tax-funded basic income policy within the basic income movement seems to assume that in order to be politically viable, children will have to receive either no basic income or a dramatically reduced basic income.  I believe I understand the armchair reasoning for this assumption, but doesn't the empirical evidence show that giving government money to children is far more popular than giving it to adults?",1

"My view is based on the principle that the party nomination processes are private affairs.  That is, the party nomination system is strictly an internal process to select the platform and candidates from a party.  The rules are public and can be known and used to the benefit of whoever understands and executes them best.

This is fundamentally okay with me because I believe it is in any party's best interests (Republican, Democrat, Green, or others) to have candidates and a platform chosen by party members.  The rules allow party leaders to make decisions that they feel are in the best interests of the parties.  It does not make sense to allow people to show up and pick candidates against the party's best interests (as determined by party leaders).  

For example, the Colorado Republican Party chose not to participate in a primary election, and to instead award delegates based on whatever rules they come up with.  Another example could be where Clinton delegates do not show up to county conventions, and are replaced with Sanders supporters.  In both cases, the rules are known in advance by all potential candidates.  It is up to the candidates to inform their potential delegates, get out the vote, and make sure the enthusiasm is there to secure as many delegates as they can under the rules.  

This isn't to say I think the process is perfect.  For example, I do not agree with use of local government funds to subsidize the private party nomination process for some parties (Republican and Democrat) and not others (Green, for example).  I am also disappointed that overall our system of government encourages only two private parties, so much that if you don't like the rules of the two major parties, it is very difficult to start your own party.

EDIT: I just realized I didn't actually address super-delegates or unbound/unpledged delegates.  Basically my argument is the same, though.  The party, being a private organization, should be able to enact whatever rules it wants to select its candidates and platform.  If that includes unbound delegates, then that fact should be made widely known to the candidates, and factor into any successful candidate's nomination strategy.

"Neat! That sounds like a fun RP you had going on there. Shame it died. I know how it feels to watch your special RP creation slowly die off. Tis a sad thing. 

I did A LOT of Pokemon RPs. The fansite I used for RPing was a Pokemon one so with it came a lot of Pokemon related RPs. I joined a lot of them. There were some original RPs as well. None of them lasted for very long though. A lot of the RPs on the site were low quality one liner posts too. I was about 15 when I started RPing and I had some fanfiction background to keep my writing ""acceptable"" enough. :p

The most unique one I've ever joined was a D&D RP. The RP creator was the DM so he had no character of his own but he would guide the rest of us with NPCs and events happening around our characters. It made it a really unique experience because we were dropped in a world with no default character to rely on to move the plot forward. (The default character being the RP creator's character who tends to lead the story forward.) the RP lasted only for a few pages sadly. Id love to experience more of an RP like that in the future. Especially since I can write better than I can act. (For a D&D type thing)

If I had any time in college Id love to join a mass effect or dragon age RP. Especially since it's a more mature/older fandom you could probably find some really creative individuals to help make an RP fun. (And hopefully avoid all the Mary Sue characters along with it) ",0

>In the end, if things are to ever become how you dream (an extremely strict and limited interpretation of the constitution, the nullification of many federal laws, etc.), you have to get a large majority of the voters to agree with you.

I agree with that statement from a practical standpoint, but feel that its truth underlines how broken our system currently is. 

We are a constitutional republic, not a democracy (for good reason). So the fact that voters need to be mobilized to try an enforce the statements already present in our constitution - shows what a state we are in.

The 4th amendment could not be more clear, ""no unreasonable search and seizure"" - why do voters need to mobilized to stop naked body scanners from being installed in all the airports, subways, courthouses, shopping malls, etc?

As an aside, National Healthcare's failure is not so much on the ""general welfare"" clause, but its only the method of its taxation. The constitution clearly states only two forms of taxation are allowed; (1) Indirect (excise tax) which is apportioned, (2) Direct (head tax) which is apportioned. 

This mandate to buy an insurance policy is a direct tax which is *not* apportioned. Therefore it fails the constitutional test for taxes that can be administered.

Gas taxes are largely used for road repair, and then it makes more sense to say ""If you use the road more than everyone else, as measured by the fuel you use, then you derive more benefit than them and should pay a larger share.""  It also encourages beneficial behavior.

"Saying ""X group should not vote"" is always a veil for one's own political positions.  As soon as you define a group whose voting power is lesser than another, you give political power to one ideological group.

The thing is, you have to come to the conclusion that if 100% of the people voted, and your candidate lost, that would be acceptable.  It's okay to lose, provided one loses fairly.  It's *specifically the lack of voting* which makes the playing field uneven.  The more people that vote, the fairer the elections are.  This is, of course, discounting the bullshit we've seen in this last election, much of which is based on targeted group voter suppression, as you're suggesting.  But to try to make people less likely to vote because you don't like their values, what they find important, or whatever, is flatly injurious to democracy.  Without a clear view of both the will of the people and the actions of the government, democracy cannot truly exist, even in the republican sense we're supposed to have here.",1

"The two main reasons as to why the USA has a presidential system are the mechanical and strategic effects of what is known as [Duverger's Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger%27s_law), and also the presidential rather than parliamentarian system of government. However, with radical reform, it is theoretically possible to move to a multi-party system, thanks to the stark social cleavages in American society - whether this would be a good thing is unknowable.

Duverger's Law is a principle in political science that states that plurality based electoral systems (So, ones where a plurality rather than a majority of votes are required to win, as nearly all American elections do) favour two party systems. There are what are called ""mechanical"" and ""strategic"" effects from plurality based voting systems which maintain this.

Mechanical effects have to do with the way votes are translated into seats, or public offices. Take a state, say, Subotania, that has multiple congressional districts, with concentrations of Republicans in the South and Democrats in the North of the state. If a new party, such as the Whig Party, is established and quickly gathers broad electoral appeal across Subotania, when it comes to election time, they'll be screwed over. As the Whig vote is spread across the state, rather than being concentrated in particular districts like the two main parties are, they'll be second place in a lot of the districts, but first in none. Under a proportional system, with congressmen elected across the state on the proportion of the votes their party receives, the Whigs stand a good chance of getting some seats.

Strategic effects have to do with how the electoral system changes voter behaviour. Even if you really like the small Whig Party, if you absolutely detest the Democrats, whilst being less unfavourable towards Republicans, under a plurality-based system, you are likely as a voter to vote in order to keep your least-preferred preference out i.e. you will vote GOP to stop the Dems from getting in. This is not a problem you would have under proportional representation, as seats are allocated on the proportion of votes each party receives. Of course, if you as the typical voter are doing this, then loads of other typical would-be Whig voters are doing the same,[ in order to stop the wrong lizard from getting in.](http://wso.williams.edu/~rcarson/lizards.html)

Another strategic effect is that new political elites, although they may prefer to set up their own party, will in a plurality based system hitch on to the party closest to their views, in order to secure power. This harms the ability of new parties to organise effectively and campaign for votes.

Multi-party systems are also a lot more common in parliamentary systems of government, as these allow for the possibility of inter-party coalitions. Given that the US Executive is concentrated in one individual, this is not possible in the USA. If you are a voter for the Whig party in a United States that has proportional elections to Congress, in order to secure preferable policy outcomes, you may vote for one of the two main party's candidates for President, in order to keep the other lizard out. If the United States had a parliamentarian system of government (Which, unlike electoral reform, is not a reform that could ever happen), then you could happily vote for the Whigs knowing that they had a chance of participating in government.

One of the necessary conditions for a multi-party system are multiple, politicised social cleavages - the United States has a bazillion of these. A social cleavage is something which makes two different groups distinct, and is potentially political. The main ones are class, religious-secular, urban-rural, peripheral-central, ethnic and materialist-post-materialist (So environmentalism vs. growth). The United States has all of these, and all are extremely politicised - it is probably only the Constitution and its electoral system which stops an actual multi-party system from developing. What's interesting is that these cleavages are often not only represented between the two main parties already (As in - most blacks vote for Democrats, those wanting a less centralised government vote Republican), but that they are also reflected within the *parties*. For example, look at environmentalism and the Democrats - most Dems in Congress are for action on CO2 emissions, except those representatives from coal states. It is the electoral system which confines such divisions within the parties and stops the development of multiple, electorally effective parties that clearly reflect these social divisions.

In conclusion, the end of the two party system requires social cleavages (which the USA has) and is really strongly helped by a proportional voting system (There are examples of two-party systems in countries with proportional voting, such as Malta, but these are very rare, and have very few social cleavages). Given the level of entrenchment of parties within the United States in the present day, electoral reform is *de facto* necessary. Voting via the internet has nothing whatsoever to do with it, and people calling for a third party without corresponding electoral reform may as well be calling to build a bridge to the moon. Pretty much any proportional system will do - I personally like the mixed German version.

"The virus was discovered in 1984, not 83. The test was on the market in 1985. HOWEVER, according to Randy Shiltz who wrote AndTheBand(...), CDC proposed testing blood for HepB stating the test was 88% accurate in identifying AIDS abnormalities and they proposed as early as 1982/1983. Blood industry declined. Moreover , they were very reluctant in supporting the research regarding if AIDS is blood transmitted or not - they could reveil lists of donors to cdc, but they decided not to do so. According to Shiltz these firms knew that some of the donors had died of AIDS but never reached out to people who received contaminated blood, so these people lived infected not even knowing that.
The hemophiliacs were being diagnosed with AIDS as early as 1981/2 and at the very beginning of the epidemics there has been a term of 4Hs representing four major groups exposed to AIDS - homosexuals, hemophiliacs, haitans,heroinists. So CDC pointed blood as a way of transmission from the very beginning, blood industry just obstructed by stating there had been not enough evidence to back up CDc's theory.

"This is the Reddit Comment I was born to write, and it is on my freaking Reddit Birthday, so read it reddit.

My short answer for how I would change the US system, (or how I would like to see my state legislature work, if numbers were adjusted)

I like the bicameral system and think it creates an oppertunity.

* Senate: Simple Instant Runoff Voting with one winner, and keep terms the same.

* House: 
1)  Have multi candidate districts out of which four representatives are elected, using a multi candidate Single Transferrable Vote method. 
2) Up the number of representatives in the house of representatives to 1000.

Now here is the long explanation of why I think this is the best system.

First we need to look at the goal of represenation.  In my mind we are trying to take the complex and scattered views throughout the country, have representatives that can speak on behalf of those views, and then create the best compromise policies possible by looking at the totality of these different viewpoints.

* Remember originally in the United States Senators were not elected.  It was not mandatory to have senators elected until the 17th amendment in 1913.  The concept was that you would have state interests represented by the appointment of senators by the state (who were elected by the voting public), and then you would have the house which was the direct voice of the people.  The idea was different viewpoints would create better policy.  I am not suggesting going back to this but think it is important when considering what the purpose of having two legislative bodies is, if both are elected the same way.

* The system of voting in my new Senate is IRV, which has been explained throughout this forum.  Here are two videos if you don't know what it is.  
[Explained with every day life example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtW3QkX8Xa0)

 [Explained in a more traditional way](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FstA45lxgFs)

Now what effect does this have on the kinds of candidates elected, and the kinds of campaigns run?  Well it means that the candidates elected tend to be more moderate (I know sad for many of us, but that is where the house of reps comes in).  Because we take out the smallest supported candidates first, and let them go to their second choice until a candidate has achieved a majority, we ensure that the candidate is one that is favored at least to some extent, by at least half the population.  Meanwhile voters now can express their preference for smaller parties by voting for them in their early choices which allows these issues to not only gain visability, but gives the more mainstream or popular candidates a chance and a strategic reason to want to court these votes in order to become their second or third choice.  This is also how this system can lead to less negative campaigning.

So we have candidates that should approximate the political center of there state in the senate who have been elected by courting minority or single issue party views that seem to resonate with voters.  Sound good right?

*Now we move onto the house.

The house has a less talked about election scheme, although it is actually similar to the preferential voting used in IRV, and thus the actual way you vote will be completely consistent.
The way this system differs is that you are no longer cutting out the smallest candidates until there is one candidate with a majority, instead we will cut small candidates until we have 4 candidates each with more than 20% of the vote.  
Here is a video to show how this works [Gummy Bears Voting!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=887sGavI9kY)

This system gives minority representation, as any candidate popular enough to achieve 20% support in a district can be a representative. 

What this means is that now you would have socialists, libertarians, greens, constitution party, working families party, neocon's, business parties, evangelicals, and ideologies of all stripes represented throughout the districts in the country.  These different groups would come together in congress, forming Caucasus's most of the time with no single party able to pass legislation on its own.  Instead the issues that would be passed, would be those that parties could come to agree on.  This means that different kinds of issues would be talked about, pushed, and would be able to pass the house than normally rise to the top of american politics.  Look at issues that cut the political parties, Physician Assisted Suicide laws for example.  Libertarians (who tend to be republicans) tend to like these laws, as do many liberals, yet more mainstream democrats are more warry.  Under our system that means no one wants to touch this issue as it alienates them from their base.  The only states that have the law passed it through referendum, with little support by established politicians.  Other examples are Marijuana legalization, cutting defense spending, and many others.  I find it easier to think of policies I support, but this would really create an environment where many policies I don't like would gain traction as well, however I think it is a better democratic process.
So to counter the moderate nature of the Senate, we instead have voting districts which ensure that in each region many viewpoints can be represented.  (Right now Rural Democrats and Urban Republicans have little voice).  This makes the house the inovative body, coming up with solutions and legislation while the senate ensures nothing to crazy gets passed.

* Now onto why I would up the house to 1000.  It comes down to campaign financing.  This election system in general makes it more difficult for moneyed interests to get their way.  Under the current system it is easy to pick winners in an election, and easy for moneyed interests to get involved in primaries early to ensure sympathetic candidates rise to the top.  However to do this to all four winning candidates is much more difficult, as each one only needs 20% of their district to support them to win.  It is much easier to get 20% through grassroots efforts, than it is to get 50%.  There are a million things to say about how having more candidates and lower winning threshold would effect campaign money, but I don't want to get to bogged down in it, and instead ask that you think about it yourself as it isn't that hard to figure out.

Now the 1000 house members.  If the purpose of lobbying and putting big money into politics is to buy/influence/gain sympathetic votes, then one way to make this much more difficult is add dramatically more votes.  If one congressmen is only one vote of 435 and maybe one of a handful on an important committee, then that is a much more valuable position to buy than if they are 1 in 1000, and one of 2 handfuls in a committee.  This makes lobbying a hell of a lot more expensive, and that is in a first past the post system, in this multi candidate STV system it would have even more of an impact.
In my mind this means more decisions will be made on the merits of the question at hand rather than pissing off the wrong people for reelection concerns.


TL DR;
Moderate senate acts as gatekeeper to a house of representatives that has political opinions all over the map in a way that more closely represents the views of voters in each district.  In addition money in politics would be less influential.

"This will be unpopular but here it goes:

The difference is that the US government is attacking identified targets. The identification process of human targets involves intelligence (to an arguable degree of certainty of course). The targets are attacked based on and after the consensus of a chain of command based on a mission objective that has the intention of reducing/mitigating global risks to various nefarious groups and people.

The aforementioned is in complete contrast with terrorism. Lets use 9/11 or ANY bombing as an example. They didn't identify ANY specific human target (in most cases, and if they did, it was based on role or office the individual holds) nor did they have any indication that successful execution of the attack would bring them closer to their objective(s). 

So, Bill Maher, yes with the simple act taken out of context, this would appear as terrorism. However, if you actually maintain the context, you have a degree of rationality and strategy which is what delineates between acts of terrorism and a civilized (stretching that word a bit here obviously).",1

Apple already admitted intelligence agencies around the world already can do it. State-endorsed cracking/hacking groups already have the tool. The only ones left out would be the good guys, the police. And it doesn't have anything to do with being able to do it, as the FBI could develop the tool on their own.

"Your example is not analogous what so ever. A club is a club and the way our government elects it's representatives the way it elects it's representatives. 

You are completely ignoring the reality that lobbyists have taken over the government and we don't actually have a choice under our election system. If you are a liberal and you vote against the democrats you are seen as losing the race for the democrats and throwing your vote away. Same goes for conservatives that vote for a third party. Our political system is fucked and you are try to preserve the status quo.

>Also, superdelegates were a response by the Democratic Party to deal with changes from within the Democratic Party (i.e., to keep the McGovern wing of the party from running off without the establishment). This is in fact a way to insulate their party from outside threats and renegade factions - not a response to changes in state laws.

My statement was a little misleading. Only a fool would think the superdelegates are newer than California's prop 14 (super open primaries). But I believe the democrats have really alienated a huge  part of the population with the way they run their party. They kind of turned their back on Carter allowing Reagan to place all the blame on him. They almost did the same thing to Obama as well but a series of victories brought many dems back to his support. The push back to be more moderate and bow down to the south which provides no electoral votes these days certainly lost the democrats the 2000 election. 

Last thing, the two parties have come to look mirror McGovern and goldwater's policies. Both lost in landslide elections but while the democrats ran from McGovern, the republicans embraced Goldwater. McGovern's strategy was to be inclusive and attract voters from all segments of the population. You know, like what 60% of discourse on election strategy is now. Part of this was fighting to make the way the dems pick nominees more inclusive as well. When they ran from this, the dems were out of the white house for 7 out of the next 10 presidencies before Obama (the outsider). Obama came and changed that big time but the democratic establishment is now fighting to get the power back again. ",1
