1,"Alright folks, so I live in Minnesocuck, the only state not to vote for Reagan, and one of the only states to vote Little Marco first, Rat second, and Trump **third.** Oh and we also were one of the first to give a certain socialist comrade a win! Go ""democratic"" socialism guise!!! Cuz it's not socialism if we **voted** for it right??

Here in MN, like the rest of reddit, the name ""Donald Trump"" is synonymous with Adolf Hitler. If I talk about my support for Trump in public, I get glares like none other. It discouraged me from fully supporting Trump for a while just because of the social pressure!

I'm what you faggots would call a cis white male shitlord. I used to be a beta pussy, but for the past 3 years, I started (***TRIGGER WARNING!!!!***) working out 5 days a week in pursuit of achieving alpha status. I work hard on my appearance, and I get much better grades than the average bear, but it is because I work for it! The SJW's see this stuff and think you don't deserve what you have. You were endowed with some magic privilege that makes everything easy.

I felt like a bit of a loner in my support for Donald. Like something was wrong with me for not being disgusted with Trump like everyone else. But alas, I have determined it is because we, the fortunate, possess the anticuck gene and are immune to this rapidly spreading, dangerous, dangerous cuckvirus. 

I could not find one person in my school (as a high school senior, 18) who shares my passion for Trump. All I hear is ""He's a bully, a dick, an overt racist, cannot be defended, and I hate him ***soooooo*** much."" Even my Republican friends think he is, ""unpresidential and a racist who doesn't like brown people."" 

Meanwhile, I hear nothing but admiration for Comrade Sandcuck. What is it with kids and socialism nowadays?? I think it's that they don't have the foresight older people have to know that IT DOESN'T WORK. Sounds great, Yeah. But it makes everyone worse off. Poverty will always exist for a few! It sucks cock but it's been that way for EVERY major civilization in history.

 America is the only place where people can be mostly free from this bullshit. If someone has a talent of value, and they put it to good use, THEY ARE REWARDED WITH MONEY. GET OVER IT. Either you have something of value or you don't. I don't want to work hard in college to get a degree in engineering just for some cuck to say ""Yeah, 50+% of what you make is ours because less fortunate people blah blah blah blah.""

Onto my main point, I should be able to support **whomever I fucking please** for president. I thought this was America!! I don't appreciate cuckos acting like all Trump supporters are some kind of uneducated racist sexist asses and that if you support Trump it's equivalent with hate speech. Not gonna happen anymore.

So that is why I love this subreddit. This is the ONE place you can support Trump and not have to deal with the BS, only love. I love checking this page every day and I love seeing all you faggots comment things like ""BUILD THE WALL."" We truly have the best shitposters, the dankest of memes, and we win and win and win thanks to our mods. And we sure as hell have more fun than S4P.


I got so fired up last night amidst Trump's YUGE victory, and subsequent losses for Sandwiches and Lyin' Ted. But especially Ted. I almost MAGA'd all over myself. Last night was too glorious, and we have so much high energy here it's amazing. This is the only place on reddit you can offend everyone and still get upvoted a ton. But we *aren't* offensive people! We are just passionate about Trump and SJW's get caught in the crossfire! No, it's more like they run into a train. With **no brakes.** You're all tremendous people and I'm so glad this community exists.

God bless, and MAGA MOTHERFUCKERS.

1,"A 35 year Government cover up to protect politicians, high ranking doctors and their friends in the pharmaceutical industry... meanwhile in France decades ago when this scandal broke politicians and doctors were sent to jail... this is when the cover up in the uk began. Civil Cervantes authorised the destruction of medical notes but yet no civil service names were ever recorded! Behind closed doors the Government have left this to go on for as long as possible. I was infected with Hep C through treatment for my Haemophilia and so was my grandad who died because of the Hep C. Can you imagine not only loosing your own dad due to infection but also facing the fact your own child, who you took to hospital to get treatment might also die at some point! Horrendous circumstance that could have been avoided instead Thatcher opted for money saving agenda instead of a potential life saving agenda. Fortunately after 18 months of brutal treatment I managed to clear the Hep C but for many others they never had the chance. A crime against the British public that should not go unpunished and answers must be given to ensure the chances of something like ever happening again are minimal.



Afraid the NHS were warned but they did nothing. It's all documented. That's why people have been seeking answers for the last 35 years? If it was as clear cut as they didn't know, it was an accident then that would be accepted but same thing happened in other countries including France - the French authorities locked up health professionals and politicians over this. That's when the UK Government started to destroy documents and amend medicinal records so their pals at the pharma companies didn't end up in the courts.



I'm one of the very lucky one's. 37, married, got two great little kids, did a gruelling 18 month course of treatment that cured the Hep C and didn't take a single day off work, have worked all my adult life and paid into the system. Compensation isn't what this is about - it's about getting answers as to why it happened and how can we make sure that my daughter who is a carrier, that one day if she has a family she doesn't have to go through what I, my family and many 1000's of others both here in the UK and across the world have had to endure.

0,"This is the Reddit Comment I was born to write, and it is on my freaking Reddit Birthday, so read it reddit.

My short answer for how I would change the US system, (or how I would like to see my state legislature work, if numbers were adjusted)

I like the bicameral system and think it creates an oppertunity.

* Senate: Simple Instant Runoff Voting with one winner, and keep terms the same.

* House: 
1)  Have multi candidate districts out of which four representatives are elected, using a multi candidate Single Transferrable Vote method. 
2) Up the number of representatives in the house of representatives to 1000.

Now here is the long explanation of why I think this is the best system.

First we need to look at the goal of represenation.  In my mind we are trying to take the complex and scattered views throughout the country, have representatives that can speak on behalf of those views, and then create the best compromise policies possible by looking at the totality of these different viewpoints.

* Remember originally in the United States Senators were not elected.  It was not mandatory to have senators elected until the 17th amendment in 1913.  The concept was that you would have state interests represented by the appointment of senators by the state (who were elected by the voting public), and then you would have the house which was the direct voice of the people.  The idea was different viewpoints would create better policy.  I am not suggesting going back to this but think it is important when considering what the purpose of having two legislative bodies is, if both are elected the same way.

* The system of voting in my new Senate is IRV, which has been explained throughout this forum.  Here are two videos if you don't know what it is.  
[Explained with every day life example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtW3QkX8Xa0)

 [Explained in a more traditional way](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FstA45lxgFs)

Now what effect does this have on the kinds of candidates elected, and the kinds of campaigns run?  Well it means that the candidates elected tend to be more moderate (I know sad for many of us, but that is where the house of reps comes in).  Because we take out the smallest supported candidates first, and let them go to their second choice until a candidate has achieved a majority, we ensure that the candidate is one that is favored at least to some extent, by at least half the population.  Meanwhile voters now can express their preference for smaller parties by voting for them in their early choices which allows these issues to not only gain visability, but gives the more mainstream or popular candidates a chance and a strategic reason to want to court these votes in order to become their second or third choice.  This is also how this system can lead to less negative campaigning.

So we have candidates that should approximate the political center of there state in the senate who have been elected by courting minority or single issue party views that seem to resonate with voters.  Sound good right?

*Now we move onto the house.

The house has a less talked about election scheme, although it is actually similar to the preferential voting used in IRV, and thus the actual way you vote will be completely consistent.
The way this system differs is that you are no longer cutting out the smallest candidates until there is one candidate with a majority, instead we will cut small candidates until we have 4 candidates each with more than 20% of the vote.  
Here is a video to show how this works [Gummy Bears Voting!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=887sGavI9kY)

This system gives minority representation, as any candidate popular enough to achieve 20% support in a district can be a representative. 

What this means is that now you would have socialists, libertarians, greens, constitution party, working families party, neocon's, business parties, evangelicals, and ideologies of all stripes represented throughout the districts in the country.  These different groups would come together in congress, forming Caucasus's most of the time with no single party able to pass legislation on its own.  Instead the issues that would be passed, would be those that parties could come to agree on.  This means that different kinds of issues would be talked about, pushed, and would be able to pass the house than normally rise to the top of american politics.  Look at issues that cut the political parties, Physician Assisted Suicide laws for example.  Libertarians (who tend to be republicans) tend to like these laws, as do many liberals, yet more mainstream democrats are more warry.  Under our system that means no one wants to touch this issue as it alienates them from their base.  The only states that have the law passed it through referendum, with little support by established politicians.  Other examples are Marijuana legalization, cutting defense spending, and many others.  I find it easier to think of policies I support, but this would really create an environment where many policies I don't like would gain traction as well, however I think it is a better democratic process.
So to counter the moderate nature of the Senate, we instead have voting districts which ensure that in each region many viewpoints can be represented.  (Right now Rural Democrats and Urban Republicans have little voice).  This makes the house the inovative body, coming up with solutions and legislation while the senate ensures nothing to crazy gets passed.

* Now onto why I would up the house to 1000.  It comes down to campaign financing.  This election system in general makes it more difficult for moneyed interests to get their way.  Under the current system it is easy to pick winners in an election, and easy for moneyed interests to get involved in primaries early to ensure sympathetic candidates rise to the top.  However to do this to all four winning candidates is much more difficult, as each one only needs 20% of their district to support them to win.  It is much easier to get 20% through grassroots efforts, than it is to get 50%.  There are a million things to say about how having more candidates and lower winning threshold would effect campaign money, but I don't want to get to bogged down in it, and instead ask that you think about it yourself as it isn't that hard to figure out.

Now the 1000 house members.  If the purpose of lobbying and putting big money into politics is to buy/influence/gain sympathetic votes, then one way to make this much more difficult is add dramatically more votes.  If one congressmen is only one vote of 435 and maybe one of a handful on an important committee, then that is a much more valuable position to buy than if they are 1 in 1000, and one of 2 handfuls in a committee.  This makes lobbying a hell of a lot more expensive, and that is in a first past the post system, in this multi candidate STV system it would have even more of an impact.
In my mind this means more decisions will be made on the merits of the question at hand rather than pissing off the wrong people for reelection concerns.


TL DR;
Moderate senate acts as gatekeeper to a house of representatives that has political opinions all over the map in a way that more closely represents the views of voters in each district.  In addition money in politics would be less influential.

1,"I'll piggy-back on this to provide some more thoughts about why I agree with /u/Honest_Discussion's prediction.

Sander's is running a legislative platform for the presidency, which is common these days. Many of his proposals would require significant legislative action. For example, Sanders is running a universal education plan would require a significant restructuring of the financial aid apparatus, changes to the revenue code, and likely the creation of a new agency to oversee it. He is also running a major legislative plan to break-up the banks. He is on the record of supporting another major overhaul of the healthcare system, which would likely require a repeal and replace of the ACA. He would like to see significant changes to early-year childcare and regulations on maternity and paternity leave, which would require significant legislative pushes.

You may support these proposals, and that is perfectly fine. I can understand why people would. I support some and don't support others.

The problem is, Sanders is not running for a legislative position, he is running for the executive. Every major policy proposal he has put forward would be almost like another ACA, a massive change to existing structures that requires significant coordination with a legislature that is not as committed to the policies as Sanders would be and that is likely to be hostile (even if the Dems make gains during his presidency).

That means that most of the 'simple' and 'common-sense' proposals Sanders puts forward in his presidency are, ultimately, out of his hands. He can recommend them, he can find friends in the legislature that help craft the legislation he wants, but ultimately all he can do is apply political pressure. With a hostile legislature, this is likely to lead to a lot of, as /u/Honest_Discussion suggests, 'non-stop gridlock, whining, and finger pointing'. If Sanders is able to get half of his policy proposals through the legislature, they will in the end rely on 'imperfect deals' that resemble the original intent only if you squint hard enough.

Sanders, of course, has been a legislator since 1991, so he knows this. He's no straight-talker or common-sense hero. He may have policy recommendations closest to your interests, and if he does than by all means vote for him. But don't expect anything close to the high expectations many will have for him if he wins, because he simply can't achieve it. To the extent he can, it will require a lot of nasty and back-room politics to get there‚Äîand 'there' will not be what you voted for.

Personally, even if you care about these issues, I don't think you should vote for Sanders. Many of his issues could be achieved in a more moderate form, or the over-arching goals could be achieved through other means, by someone with more refined political skills. But I personally think Sanders will be unlikely to yield these results. He's a populist legislator, and its telling that while he has a lot of big legislative plans he hasn't taken the lead in achieving them in the 24 years he's been there. You'd be better off finding someone who had the executive skills required to actually improve the functioning of our government and marshall less hostile legislative coalitions."

1,Mr Mac   So in your opinion being a pedophile makes you a â€œreal manâ€.  Damn.  Republicans have become totally unhinged.
1,"My view is based on the principle that the party nomination processes are private affairs.  That is, the party nomination system is strictly an internal process to select the platform and candidates from a party.  The rules are public and can be known and used to the benefit of whoever understands and executes them best.

This is fundamentally okay with me because I believe it is in any party's best interests (Republican, Democrat, Green, or others) to have candidates and a platform chosen by party members.  The rules allow party leaders to make decisions that they feel are in the best interests of the parties.  It does not make sense to allow people to show up and pick candidates against the party's best interests (as determined by party leaders).  

For example, the Colorado Republican Party chose not to participate in a primary election, and to instead award delegates based on whatever rules they come up with.  Another example could be where Clinton delegates do not show up to county conventions, and are replaced with Sanders supporters.  In both cases, the rules are known in advance by all potential candidates.  It is up to the candidates to inform their potential delegates, get out the vote, and make sure the enthusiasm is there to secure as many delegates as they can under the rules.  

This isn't to say I think the process is perfect.  For example, I do not agree with use of local government funds to subsidize the private party nomination process for some parties (Republican and Democrat) and not others (Green, for example).  I am also disappointed that overall our system of government encourages only two private parties, so much that if you don't like the rules of the two major parties, it is very difficult to start your own party.

EDIT: I just realized I didn't actually address super-delegates or unbound/unpledged delegates.  Basically my argument is the same, though.  The party, being a private organization, should be able to enact whatever rules it wants to select its candidates and platform.  If that includes unbound delegates, then that fact should be made widely known to the candidates, and factor into any successful candidate's nomination strategy.

1,"The virus was discovered in 1984, not 83. The test was on the market in 1985. HOWEVER, according to Randy Shiltz who wrote AndTheBand(...), CDC proposed testing blood for HepB stating the test was 88% accurate in identifying AIDS abnormalities and they proposed as early as 1982/1983. Blood industry declined. Moreover , they were very reluctant in supporting the research regarding if AIDS is blood transmitted or not - they could reveil lists of donors to cdc, but they decided not to do so. According to Shiltz these firms knew that some of the donors had died of AIDS but never reached out to people who received contaminated blood, so these people lived infected not even knowing that.
The hemophiliacs were being diagnosed with AIDS as early as 1981/2 and at the very beginning of the epidemics there has been a term of 4Hs representing four major groups exposed to AIDS - homosexuals, hemophiliacs, haitans,heroinists. So CDC pointed blood as a way of transmission from the very beginning, blood industry just obstructed by stating there had been not enough evidence to back up CDc's theory. They just used the fact that you dont find the infectious agent overnight and it took 3 years to identify that AIDS is caused by a virus in semen/blood."

1,"In that same vein, once I (irrationally) decide to do something, I'm going to do it no matter how poorly prepared I am or poorly conceived the activity is. People like to say that they want to do something amazing some day when they have the time or the money -- I just do those things. I've bumbled my way all over the world & done a lot of amazing stuff &, as long as I don't focus on the insane reasons I did it all, I can be proud of my accomplishments. I'm not afraid of the unknown, or danger, or effort & it's led me to some of the most incredible experiences of my life.

As for the ""bad example friend,"" I used to call myself the President of the Bad Decisions Club & whenever anyone protested & claimed they had made more bad decisions than I, I would say ""yes, but I knew they were terrible decisions going into them & I did it anyway. You were drunk for yours, I don't have that excuse."" Thus, I am the reigning President of the Bad Decisions Club, even though I don't make those bad choices anymore.

I think we have too much tendency to get down on ourselves for what we don't have as bpd sufferers, but we do get some benefits that we should be thankful for. We really do develop into wise people if we don't kill ourselves first. When you think about it, we cram 3 lifetimes of emotional experience & probably 1.5 lifetimes of serious self reflection into a single life. It's not worth it necessarily, but it's something positive to be gained. Wisdom is struggle, ignorance is bliss."

Anyhow, most of the national ideas are just variants of a few basic themes in the end. Bonuses to morale or discipline, combat ability, missionary strength, trade efficiency, etc. But there are a few nations have truly unique ones that aren't shared in any form with other countries. Spain for example has that NI that allows them to claim any overseas province in the WORLD, regardless of whether they have any territory near it or not. There's no accounting for how useful that is. France has that idea that reduces native attacks and makes them likelier to assimilate, which is awesome for colonizing. 

The national idea that gives a +.5 bonus to republican tradition is also really sweet, I think Novgorod and Ireland share it."

1,"There has been a lot of debate why /r/Atheism seems to just attack Christians and rightfully so.  It is actually easily explained and has two root causes.  
The first of all is a lot of the people who post on /r/Atheism are ex Christians who were forced into Christianity.  They feel like they were taken advantage of when they were children and posting anti-Christian post on /r/atheism without social and financial consequence is how they fight back.  
The next one is the Christian attempt to interfere in peoples lives.  From Gay Marriage, Abortion, non-secularism to Evolution, Christians attempt to interfere in science and peoples bed rooms.  You combine this was hypocrisy and you are going to piss off a lot of people.  If other religions gain the power to affect the political and social fabric in the United States Christians have you will start to see a lot of attacks on that religion, people hate being told what to do.  Except for you UK, there should be way more anti-Islam I expect more anti-Islam stuff from you guys.  Someone knocks a beer out of my hand on purpose I am knocking their teeth down their throat.  Where did all the soccer hooligans go?  So keep the anti-religion going, a lot of the Christians hate us because we are effective and see us as a threat.  We are telling the King he has no cloths on and the people are listening.  It is the free flow of information that will kill religion

edit-1 I also like to mention certain Christian Sects are not attacked on /r/Atheism while others are mentioned very often.  A lot of it has to do with their interference in other peoples lives.  If Christians would leave people alone they wouldn't be attacked as much.  You reap what you sow "
1,What the hell has happened to BBC News??  Jesus H. Christ!
1,Was Clinton hitting on teen girls??? What double standard?
1,"This will be unpopular but here it goes:

The difference is that the US government is attacking identified targets. The identification process of human targets involves intelligence (to an arguable degree of certainty of course). The targets are attacked based on and after the consensus of a chain of command based on a mission objective that has the intention of reducing/mitigating global risks to various nefarious groups and people.

The aforementioned is in complete contrast with terrorism. Lets use 9/11 or ANY bombing as an example. They didn't identify ANY specific human target (in most cases, and if they did, it was based on role or office the individual holds) nor did they have any indication that successful execution of the attack would bring them closer to their objective(s). 

So, Bill Maher, yes with the simple act taken out of context, this would appear as terrorism. However, if you actually maintain the context, you have a degree of rationality and strategy which is what delineates between acts of terrorism and a civilized (stretching that word a bit here obviously)."

I think the reason he is being called black is because obviously his genes have made him using predominantly black coding. Even though his parents are black and white it doesn't mean things are split evenly. Physically the best explanation is to call him black because he is half black and looks only black. So when other predominantly black models may become accepted it will be because of a guy that looks just like them. I don't know how to better explain what I mean but I really don't think this video was meant to be racist in any way. Calling him biracial is true, calling him white is true, calling him black is true( or half true however one sees it), so really i think it's all right...I though he was simply a black guy until they pointed out ""he's biracial"". I have friends who are not biracial who look more Asian than he does...it's all up to the genes man...but any way what is the definition of mixed race? How many generations away does it have to be for u to qualify because im sure most people we meet today will be mixed with races other than black....this was just a random question here at the end since he said he wants to fight for other mixed race kids."

1,"> It is simply my view that going to war with feminism is a waste of energy, but gender specific issues do not need to be a militant war of attrition.

Meanwhile RAINN just took our position on 'Rape Culture':

>In 16 pages of recommendations, RAINN urged the task focus to remain focused on the true cause of the problem. ‚ÄúIn the last few years, there has been an unfortunate trend towards blaming ‚Äúrape culture‚Äù for the extensive problem of sexual violence on campuses. While it is helpful to point out the systemic barriers to addressing the problem, it is important to not lose sight of a simple fact: Rape is caused not by cultural factors but by the conscious decisions, of a small percentage of the community, to commit a violent crime,‚Äù said the letter to the task force from RAINN‚Äôs president, Scott Berkowitz, and vice president for public policy, Rebecca O‚ÄôConnor.

So tell me again how going to war with feminists (positions) is a waste of time...

1,"Dear Americans, no one is coming to take your guns. Why do you fear small provisions as if it's the end of the world? I have no studies or polls I trust so I‚Äôm not going to put any numbers up but, can you guys just please see this from outside the box for one sec?

Everywhere there are stricter gun laws, gun deaths are lower. Even if you want to hunt, who needs 30 bullets to stop a deer? You will still have the access and ability to buy guns. If the federal government banned the carrying of handguns, won't mean you can't have your handgun. I just never understood the mentality of ""I need my AR-15, 500 round, suppressor, laser sited, grenade launching, and exploding bullet gun to protect my family.""

You guys seem to think that once someone becomes president, they become a foreigner and want to break the laws. Obama is just as American as Ronald Reagan, as was Lincoln. The government is not going to take the guns. And if they do I think it will be a little more obvious; and if that day comes, sure, start your rebellion. I'm sure when four score and seven years ago the fore-fathers drafted the constitution, they had no idea muskets would turn into 30 round AK-47 rifles. They wrote this amendment for MUSKETS. I bet 100 bucks if they were alive today they'd be ashamed, and re-write the rules to be something about owning 5 clip mag rifle. Something to stall an enemy force till the real military could arrive.

Another note I never got was, the constitution says ""Arms for a well-regulated militia."" Not ""Everyone has guns yay, shoot thy neighbor if he walks on your lawn."" Militia: (Noun) a military force that is raised from the civil population to supplement a regular army in an emergency. How is Bill down the street a militia? I'm sorry but I don't see the downside to having an AR-15 with a 5 clip mag, which can't be held in public and has to be stored away properly as a bad thing. You can still hunt, you can still defend your family, you can still form a militia.

But then again I'm Canadian... what do I know.

TLDR: Calm your tits, no one is taking your guns, the Government is not waging war against the people, and you have a massive gun problem.

PSS: If you know the proper form this should be posted in, please let me know. And i'm being 100% sincere when I wrote this."

The United Kingdom for several years had a Baby Bond program where every baby born there was given a small bond from the government, and I believe there may be a few local governments in the U.S. with a similar program.

AND YET, nearly every proposal I have seen for a tax-funded basic income policy within the basic income movement seems to assume that in order to be politically viable, children will have to receive either no basic income or a dramatically reduced basic income.  I believe I understand the armchair reasoning for this assumption, but doesn't the empirical evidence show that giving government money to children is far more popular than giving it to adults?"

>In the end, if things are to ever become how you dream (an extremely strict and limited interpretation of the constitution, the nullification of many federal laws, etc.), you have to get a large majority of the voters to agree with you.

I agree with that statement from a practical standpoint, but feel that its truth underlines how broken our system currently is. 

We are a constitutional republic, not a democracy (for good reason). So the fact that voters need to be mobilized to try an enforce the statements already present in our constitution - shows what a state we are in.

The 4th amendment could not be more clear, ""no unreasonable search and seizure"" - why do voters need to mobilized to stop naked body scanners from being installed in all the airports, subways, courthouses, shopping malls, etc?

As an aside, National Healthcare's failure is not so much on the ""general welfare"" clause, but its only the method of its taxation. The constitution clearly states only two forms of taxation are allowed; (1) Indirect (excise tax) which is apportioned, (2) Direct (head tax) which is apportioned. 

This mandate to buy an insurance policy is a direct tax which is *not* apportioned. Therefore it fails the constitutional test for taxes that can be administered.

1,">  Even if my some even more unlikely miracle Sanders became POTUS he would either have to relent to the power of the American bourgeoisie or prepare to die (is it really so outrageous to think that a socialist American president would not make it to the end of his term alive?).

This kind of catastrophist stuff always makes me lol. First of all, the biggest obstacle Sanders will face won't be the Pentagon but a hostile Republican Congress (although I think if Sanders is on the ballot in November 2016 the GOP stands a chance of losing control of both houses). Secondly, Sanders isn't about to establish the dictatorship of the proletariat or seize major industries or anything remotely life-threatening to the big bourgeoisie of this country. They won't organize a coup to save Citizens United -- heck, they didn't even organize a coup to oust FDR. I'm sure they will fight him and oppose him at all turns, but coups and things like that are their last line of defense, not their first.

As for Sanders' chances of winning against Clinton, [it's a real possibility](https://pplswar.wordpress.com/2015/06/24/sanders-can-win-the-democratic-presidential-primary-heres-how-2/) and not impossible given that socialist Upton Sinclair [did something similar in 1934.](https://revolutionaryds.wordpress.com/2015/01/29/how-upton-sinclair-upended-californias-democratic-party-and-the-lessons-for-bernie-sanders-2016-run/). Even if he loses to Clinton, there's a lot of value in the Sanders campaign (good article on that topic [here](http://newpol.org/content/assessing-sanders-campaign) -- he's rehabilitating the legitimacy of socialism on a mass scale, he'll boost Jill Stein's vote, and he'll draw in huge numbers of politically inexperienced people who will go onto other activist projects and left electoral campaigns."

All I'll add is that Christianity is constantly changing because the people within that faith are always changing.  Christianity, and religion in general, has always adapted to its believers and the world in which it exists.  From the 95 Theses (and before) to present day faiths (both liberal and conservative), Christianity has changed along with its followers.  Of course there are major elements that will always stay the same (I doubt any Christian sect will ever revise the Ten Commandments, etc), but so much of organized religion exists within the community of its believers, that it can't help but change.  


Some of the things that OP lists (homosexuality, the theological examining of Heaven and Hell, putting faith into practice) have changed dramatically, even within the most conservative sects of Christianity.  How many years ago was it widely thought that it was an abomination for races to intermarry?  How many years before was slavery considered to be a morally defensible practice?


Faith can adapt to a changing world and changing people.  New circumstances can shed new light on old teachings.  This doesn't negate or discount what you might have believed before.  It's just different.  I don't see anything wrong with that.



As an aside, if you believe that faith should be rigid or unyielding, I don't think this is the subreddit, the website nor the medium for you.  The internet and its denizens are a constantly evolving collection of ideas and discussions.  This place is all about questions and debate and exchange.  All of those things change ideas and change minds.  "

1,"Saying ""X group should not vote"" is always a veil for one's own political positions.  As soon as you define a group whose voting power is lesser than another, you give political power to one ideological group.

The thing is, you have to come to the conclusion that if 100% of the people voted, and your candidate lost, that would be acceptable.  It's okay to lose, provided one loses fairly.  It's *specifically the lack of voting* which makes the playing field uneven.  The more people that vote, the fairer the elections are.  This is, of course, discounting the bullshit we've seen in this last election, much of which is based on targeted group voter suppression, as you're suggesting.  But to try to make people less likely to vote because you don't like their values, what they find important, or whatever, is flatly injurious to democracy.  Without a clear view of both the will of the people and the actions of the government, democracy cannot truly exist, even in the republican sense we're supposed to have here."

You are completely ignoring the reality that lobbyists have taken over the government and we don't actually have a choice under our election system. If you are a liberal and you vote against the democrats you are seen as losing the race for the democrats and throwing your vote away. Same goes for conservatives that vote for a third party. Our political system is fucked and you are try to preserve the status quo.

>Also, superdelegates were a response by the Democratic Party to deal with changes from within the Democratic Party (i.e., to keep the McGovern wing of the party from running off without the establishment). This is in fact a way to insulate their party from outside threats and renegade factions - not a response to changes in state laws.

My statement was a little misleading. Only a fool would think the superdelegates are newer than California's prop 14 (super open primaries). But I believe the democrats have really alienated a huge  part of the population with the way they run their party. They kind of turned their back on Carter allowing Reagan to place all the blame on him. They almost did the same thing to Obama as well but a series of victories brought many dems back to his support. The push back to be more moderate and bow down to the south which provides no electoral votes these days certainly lost the democrats the 2000 election. 

Last thing, the two parties have come to look mirror McGovern and goldwater's policies. Both lost in landslide elections but while the democrats ran from McGovern, the republicans embraced Goldwater. McGovern's strategy was to be inclusive and attract voters from all segments of the population. You know, like what 60% of discourse on election strategy is now. Part of this was fighting to make the way the dems pick nominees more inclusive as well. When they ran from this, the dems were out of the white house for 7 out of the next 10 presidencies before Obama (the outsider). Obama came and changed that big time but the democratic establishment is now fighting to get the power back again. "

I have a huge problem with that as well, not to mention the drones that will be flying over the US in the next couple of years. However, you won't see me complaining about taxes - but rather the need to change policy. 

>As far as I can tell Libertarians believed that these needs could be better met through private industries and charities

The fundamental flaw with private charities (don't get me wrong I fully support charities) is that they are severely under-equipped to handle everyone's basic needs. Second, we shouldn't have majority of people living at the whim of charitable giving of other people. In my perspective, government performs these functions much more better due to the resources and tools available to it. Private charities are great as supplemental to government social safety nets - but they shouldn't be the primary resource for aid. 

>I think it is also believed that government intervention in the economy also in the cause of massive recessions and depressions in the first place. 

While I don't dispute this - my criticism in this regard is levied at the Federal Reserve and their monetary policies. It's their monetary policies that result in the devaluing and inflating of the dollar thereby lowering everyone's purchasing power to consume goods because asset prices like commodities are more expensive.

>My problem with the philosophy is how to make that transition from our current state to a libertarian society.

I would say that people like myself who like to have paved roads, police, fire, and schools (all funded by taxes) would prevent a true libertarian society from happening. 

>How do we get people on their feet and how do we deal with the current inequality what we are faced with. 

Very good question and I don't really have an answer for it (at least not one that you would like). I will say that for a capitalistic society to be successful, inequality needs to be low. High inequality leads to the collapse of capitalism.

1,"Lucy, I see your lesser of two evils point here. But just because you have the choice between two psychopath killers doesn't mean that the one who has killed the least amount of people is better. It means you are fucked no matter who you choose. Many of us here are just pointing out this election, there is no choice. Hillary or the peasant businessman who donates to her campaign because he knows she has friends in places he cannot reach now with his peasant status. Or a bunch of  other republican douchebags who cannot wait to barter for their masters at Goldman sachs. Or an old communist bag named Bernie, who will be as perfect manchurian candidate as Jimmy Carter. Sometimes, we just gotta call it what it is..we are at the point where if voting mattered, it would be banned. If the House always wins, we gotta stop playing their game."

1,"The thing that mainly swayed Cenk is that wikileaks told Trump Jr. that it would be more interesting to challenge the election results. Damning? Sure. But consider me unconvinced. Wikileaks is in the business of finding information by whatever means possible. If they are talking to Trump Jr., they'll sound cozy to him, to try to get on his good side. This happens in journalism all the time. Wikileaks had plenty of reason to believe there were major issues with the US electoral system (many of which are already public knowledge), and sending the Trumps out like bulls in a china shop would be one way of doing that."

But some go back to Africa to train to be militants and some are getting recruited through social media for Isis. They get in fights all the time at school, don't put any effort into their work and presentations, they don't assimilate, they gang up and talk in their language so nobody can understand them, and they get in trouble all the time. A lot of them get reduced or free lunch, and it jacks the prices of food way up for everyone else. I have to pay 3 bucks for 4 fucking mozarella sticks. Also, two years ago a white girl posted a picture on twitter of her wearing the drapes over her head and Somalians threatened to shoot up the school. So that was great. They didn't have the balls, but it was a scare nonetheless. I only know one Somalian who tries in school and he's a really cool kid. He's a Sanders cuck, but a really nice kid."
