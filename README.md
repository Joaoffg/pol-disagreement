# pol-disagreement
Political disagreement in non-political spaces


**Classifiers folder**

Contains content classifiers and training data relevant for the goals of the project, namely:

 - A disagreement classifier that determines if a text contains expressions of disagreement;
 - A political content classifier that determines if a text contains political content.

These classifiers should generalize for Reddit, Facebook and Youtube text data (comments, posts, video descriptions).
